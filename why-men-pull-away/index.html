            <p>Maggie was confused. Rick had blown her away on their first two dates. No guy had ever worked so hard to impress her.</p>
            <p>And impressed she was. He was attentive, respectful, gentle and engaged.</p>
            <p>But then, just when she decided she'd fallen for him...poof. He withdrew.</p>
            <p>Now their roles had reversed. Overnight, she was working to get his attention.</p>

            <h3>Why do men do that? Why do men shut women out?</h3>
            <p>Certainly, not every man pulls away when things start to heat up, but a lot of guys do.</p>
            <p> Enough, in fact, that this is a common question among the women I work with as a dating and relationship coach. </p>
            <p>Guys come on strong, pursuing with enough passion to make Romeo jealous, but when they win the attention of their Juliet, it's game over.</p>
            <p>What gives?</p>
            <p>Look, dating's a tough gig. Yes, it's fun and exciting, but it's also nerve-racking. </p>
            <p>At first, it's all about the chase. He's trying to get your attention, and you're deciding whether or not he's worth it.</p>
            <p> That's the time in any dating relationship when both people are so wrapped up in the pursuit that they're hardly giving any thought to what will come next.</p>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <h3>And then, the pursuit changes.</h3>
            <p> You decide you're into the guy, and he, having won your attention, has to begin the process of considering an actual, serious relationship. Does he want one? </p>
            <p>More than likely he does, or he wouldn't have been chasing you!</p>
            <p> But, wanting it and being fearless enough to really go after it are two different things.</p>
            <p>So, what's a girl to do? </p>
            <p>Well, first I'll tell you what you should NOT do.</p>

            <h3>Avoid These Two Common Mistakes</h3>
            <p>First, don't assume it's about you. It almost certainly isn't. He was into you before you decided you were into him. He's still into you, now. </p>
            <p>Second, don't pressure him. This is where a lot of the advice columns get it wrong. They often say you should play "hard to get" or some version of it.  </p>
            <p>Instead, let him know you're interested in him.</p>
            <p> Do it in ways that don't smother or push. (Text messages every hour, on the hour, for example, might be over-doing it.)</p>
            <p>Why do men pull away and shut women out at this phase of a relationship? Because he's a little nervous.  He's nervous about giving up the freedom of choice.  </p>

         <div class="col-md-2"></div>
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <h3>Don't change, be the woman he fell in love with</h3>
            <p>During the pursuit phase, it's desire that motivates him.  As soon as he realizes this could be something real, his motivation shifts.  </p>
            <p>Suddenly he's thinking about the many options he will give up, and the lifestyle changes he's committing to.</p>
            <p> (A lot of guys have an irrational fear that all their activities will all become feminized if they commit to a woman.)</p>
            <p>When he's acting this way, you don't have to change what you're doing.  When he acts distant, your best bet is to appear calm and comfortable.</p>
            <p> Be the woman he fell in love with (carefree, confident, and available). </p>
            <p>Don't freak out—that'll freak him out. Don't demand his attention—that'll send him running. And don't launch into a panic that he's seen some fatal flaw in you.</p>
          <p>Because that thought process will put you in a negative frame of mind, and that's anything but attractive. </p>

            <h3>Always Assume The Best</h3>
            <p>He pursued you for the first few dates, hoping you'd decide you were into him. He's gone out on a limb before.</p>
            <p> Now it's your turn. Give him enough space to feel comfortable while still letting him know you're interested.</p>
            <p>Any guy who truly wants a mature, real relationship will come around as soon as he sees there's nothing there to be afraid of.</p>
            <p> And any guy who's not ready for a real relationship wasn't the catch you thought he was, anyway!</p>
            <p>Now, before you settle into "waiting mode," I'd like to share a shortcut that can pull him back and rekindle his passionate pursuit at lightening speed. </p>
            <p>There's nothing wrong with being patient, but if you want to pour a little miracle grow on your relationship, here's what I recommend you do next...</p>

            <h3>When He Shuts You Out, Try This...</h3>
            <p>Survey research shows men would rather be respected than loved. It's wired into our DNA.</p>
            <p> We feel an irrational need to earn your respect as an avenue to becoming worthy of your love.</p>
            <p>Now look, as a male dating coach working primarily with women, I know how crazy this must sound to you. But it's true.</p>
            <p> It's one of the few "secrets" that really can give you an unfair advantage with men.</p>
            <p>Here's how this knowledge can help.</p>
            <p> If you channel a man's deep desire to earn your respect in the right ways, he will bend over backward for you.</p>
            <p> And the more he does this, the easier it becomes for him to see himself in a long-term committed relationship with you.</p>

            <h3>And his favorite way to earn your respect?</h3>
            <p> He wants to be heroic. He wants to solve problems for you, come to your aid, and prove himself useful.</p>
            <p> It's not very romantic, but it's woven into the fabric of his DNA.</p>
            <p>And that's why I've put together a video explaining this phenomenon further so you can tap into his hero instinct anytime you want, even if he's currently asking for space.</p>
