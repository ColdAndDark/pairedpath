            <p><h3>Would you get into a relationship if you knew it wasn’t going to last?</h3></p>
            <p>Many of us, if given a crystal ball, would take one look at the last days of a love affair and swear off that relationship completely.</p>
            <p>There’s no point in falling for someone if it’s going to end THAT badly.</p>
            <p>Or is there?</p>
            <p>It goes without saying that breakups are bad. Divorce is even worse.</p>
            <p>When a relationship ends, you may experience depression, anxiety, insomnia, skin flare-ups, aches and pains, drastic weight loss or gain, or illness.</p>
            <p>One cardiologist reported seeing a greater incidence of heart attacks in people who’d recently broken up.</p>
            <p> Breaking up can literally break your heart.</p>
            <br /><h3>But have breakups been given a bad rap?</h3>
            <p>Is it really true that the only worthwhile relationships are those that last forever?</p>
            <p>Ty Tashiro and Patricia Frazier from the University of Minnesota believe that we’ve overlooked the possibility of achieving "positive life changes following relationship breakups."</p>
            <p>In a 2003 study of broken-hearted undergraduates, they found evidence that breakups spurred personal growth, particularly in women.</p>

            <h3>Has this ever happened to you or someone you know?</h3>
            <p>You broke up with someone you really liked.</p>
            <p> Determined to prove that he made a huge mistake by letting you go, you embarked on a campaign to become a "new you."</p>
            <p>You started an exercise program, bought new clothes, and filled your life with a whirl of social activities.</p>
            <p>Even though thoughts of your ex intruded at times, you forcibly kept your mind on the future and your amazing life ahead.</p>
            <br /><h3>You refused to let him make you sad any more.</h3>
            <p>It’s very possible that this new life you created for yourself is better than the old one in every way.</p>
            <p> Which means that the breakup wasn’t a bad thing, but rather something good.</p>
            <p> Breaking up can change your life for the better.</p>
            <p>In the breakups=bad and relationships=good equation, it’s easy to forget that not all relationships have a positive impact on your life.</p>

            <h3>He may not be the best influence.</h3>
          <p>Even though you may love someone very much and treasure his presence in your life, he may not be the best influence.</p>
          <P>Having a partner who likes eating pizza, drinking beer, and watching television on his time off can impact your health, if you choose to join him in those activities.</p>
          <p>A partner who is often angry or negative can increase your stress levels.</p>
          <br /><h3>Your partner can also influence whether or not you pursue your dreams.</h3>
          <p> If he thinks your career goals are silly or unrealistic, or if he thinks it’s a waste of money to go back to school, you may put your dreams on the back burner.</p>
          <P>It’s hard to see all the ways in which your choice of partner is affecting your life until the relationship ends and you’re free again.</p>
          <P>As scary as being on your own may seem, being single gives you the chance to rediscover who you are.</p>

          <h3>The Silver Lining</h3>
          <P>Rediscovering yourself is part of the secret for getting over a breakup. </p>
          <P>You can eat what you want, listen to your own music, and watch what you want on television, even if no one else shares your tastes.</p>
          <p> You can spend your free time exactly as you like. You don’t have to change for anyone.</p>
          <P>No wonder Tashiro and Frazier found that women grow so much after a breakup.</p>
          <p> Relationships, as wonderful as they feel, can be limiting. Finding yourself single again can be self-empowering.</p>
          <P>Perhaps breakups aren’t the demon everyone has made them out to be.</p>
          <br /><h3>Perhaps breakups are the wisest teachers.</h3>
          <P>You might even say that it’s worth getting into a relationship that doesn’t last, because of the self-knowledge you’ll gain from the experience.</p>
          <P>Even if you had a crystal ball, would you still say yes to those relationships that ended badly?</p>
          <P>Can you think of any benefits you experienced from breaking up that you wouldn’t have got any other way?</p>

            <h3>Single Again?</h3>
            <P>Not all breakups ruin your life. Some breakups make your life.</p>
            <P>So, if you’ve found yourself single again, use this time to learn everything you can about yourself, your tastes, and the kind of relationship you want next.</p>
            <P>By the way, one of the best ways to get over a breakup is to fall in love with someone new.</p>
            <p> A relationship that makes your heart sing is (in my opinion) the remedy for a broken heart</p>
            <P>To help with that, I’d like to share a secret with you.</p>
            <br /><h3>It’s a secret about the way men think. </h3>
            <P>As a dating and relationship coach I’ve tested this one simple idea with thousands of women who wanted to win back the affections of a man or spark a connection with someone new. </p>
            <P>I’ve created a short video to explain what I discovered and why it helps women create the relationship they want.</p>
            <p> Here’s the <a href="https://hop.clickbank.net/?affiliate=coldace&vendor=hissecret&lp=7&ap=f"><strong>link to go watch my video now</strong></a> that has the power to forever change your luck with men. </p>
