            <p><h3>Did you share a special connection with a guy?</h3></p>
            <p>And despite his recent actions, you know he felt it too? </p>
            <p>Well, I believe that's a relationship worth fighting for. And the good news is I may have a way for you to rekindle things with your ex. </p>
            <p>Because no matter what a man claims, he wants that beautiful connection back too.</p>
            <p>But he won't let himself act on those feelings when he's trying to move on. </p>
            <p>As a dating coach and relationship expert, here's what I've noticed about this situation...</p>
            <p>A man who is closed off to a relationship with you believes the last chapter has been written.</p>
            <p>He envisions the story of your relationship as having ended; the last page of the last chapter already written. </p>
            <p>To get him back, you must change that mental framework.</p>
            <br /><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">If you're in a hurry and you need to skip ahead, here's <a href="https://hop.clickbank.net/?affiliate=coldace&vendor=hissecret&lp=7&ap=f"><strong>a video explaining the technique</strong></a> that has resulted in hundreds of spontaneous testimonials from women all across the world.</a></div><br />
            <p>Here's the problem with us men as I see it.</p>
            <p> We try to think our way through romantic relationships. That's why "logic" gets in the way of reconnecting with your ex. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="third-section">
      <div class="col-md-4 third-section-bg"></div>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row third-section-content">
          <div class="col-md-8 pt-5 pb-5 pr-5">
            <h3>Logic tells him he tried it and things didn't work out. </h3>
            <p>To succeed, you have to bypass his logic in order to reach his heart.</p>
            <p> You have to connect with his emotional desires directly.  </p>
            <p>This requires the activation of a deeper kind of wisdom that is often silenced by rational, conscious thought.</p>
            <p> You want to re-open the story of your relationship. </p>
            <p>Your job is to change the way he frames the relationship in his mind.</p>
            <br /><h3>This opens his mind to the possibility that the last chapter has not yet been written. </h3>
            <p>This is not something you rush into.</p>
            <p> You don't start and end this process in a single conversation. Rather, you simply plant a seed in his mind. </p>
            <p>That seed can be something as simple as a question. You use suggestive language to plant a question in his mind. </p>
            <p>Why? Because the human mind cannot ignore a question of this sort. </p>
            <p>Our minds try to answer questions by evaluating various possible answers.</p>
            <p> That's all it takes to open his mind to the possibility that what he thought was the end of your story was actually only the beginning. </p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <h3>This is where things get interesting.</h3>
            <p>One option is to phrase it like this:</p>
            <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <p><i>"I find myself wondering if the last chapter of our relationship has actually been written. I don't know why that question keeps popping into my mind." </i></p>
          </div>
            <p>Say it in a casual tone and without any pause afterward for him to reply. It's just something amusing you notice about your own stream of consciousness. </p>
            <br /><h3>Saying this raises the question in his mind. </h3>
            <p>His subconscious will be influenced by that question even if he tries to consciously ignore the possibility.</p>
            <p>The way suggestion works, there are no negatives.</p>
            <p> If I tell you, "Your leg no longer hurts," the impact on the subconscious mind is thoughts, feelings, and imagery representing the word "hurts."</p>
            <p> The "no longer" part gets ignored.</p>
            <p>That's why hypnotists use only positive language for the suggestions they want to instill in someone's mind. </p>
            <p>Hypnotists say, "Notice how comfortable and relaxed your leg becomes with each passing moment."</p>
            <p> They don't say "Notice how your leg stopped hurting." </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="fifth-section">
      <div class="col-md-4 fifth-section-bg"></div>

        <div class="row justify-content-end">
          <div class="col-md-8 pl-md-5 fifth-section-content">
            <h3>Plant the Idea in His Mind...by Creating Space</h3>
            <p>Raising the question of what could happen between the two of you (in the future) causes his mind to automatically fill that space. </p>
            <p>It's like the movie, Inception. If you haven't seen it, Inception is a movie about planting the seed of an idea in someone else's mind.</p>
            <p> They do so by entering someone's dreams through a special device that allows several people to share the same dream. </p>
            <p>In the movie, the "architect" of the dream creates a safe...like a metal box for keeping secret papers and valuables.</p>
            <p> Once that "space" is created, the dreamer unconsciously fills that safe with things they want to keep hidden, tucked safely away.</p>
            <p> It's an automatic unconscious instinct. </p>
            <p>That fictional plotline is based on the reality of how the subconscious mind works, as discovered through hundreds of years of refining hypnotic suggestion.</p>
            <p>Once his mind is open to the possibility of being loved by you again, he will start to question himself.</p>
            <br /><h3> He will wonder if he still has any feelings for you.</h3>
           <p> That question will cause him to crack open the door to his heart just enough to search for those feelings.</p>
            <p>This is what we were aiming for. This is the key that unlocks the next chapter.  </p>

            <h3>Unlock the Next Chapter of Your Relationship</h3>
            <p>Once a new page is turned, the story of your relationship can begin again.</p>
            <p> It's a blank page just begging to be written. And if you really want that new story to build toward a climax of joy and relationship bliss, I have a recommendation for you.</p>
            <p><strong>It's a secret about the male mind.</strong> It's something even men do not understand about themselves. </p>
            <p>It's the one thing they crave more desperately than anything else.</p>
            <p> It's an instinctual drive he cannot ignore, and something few women know how to give.</p>
            <br /><h3> It's the one thing men secretly want but could never tell you. </h3>
            <p>It's so important that I've created a <a href="https://hop.clickbank.net/?affiliate=coldace&vendor=hissecret&lp=7&ap=f">free video presentation</a> to explain what it is and how you can use it to get him back for good. </p>
            <p>Click the button below to see my short presentation and master something that will forever change your "luck" with men.</p>
            <p> It really is an unfair advantage that I want to give you, but I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you <strong>will use this knowledge </strong>to capture his heart.</p>
